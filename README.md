# DOM I - JavaScript Content Management System

## Project Description

You are going to be emulating a content management system by controlling the content in the JavaScript file instead of the HTML file. This project is an exercise pointed at selecting elements and then updating them without touching the HTML file using the DOM.

Compare `index.html` against `original.html` and notice how `index.html` is lacking text content and other things. The goal is to make the page look the same as `original.html` using JavaScript.

You have been provided a [JSON object](js/index.js) with all the necessary data to accomplish this task.  Use dot or bracket notation to traverse the data provided.

**ONE RULE: You cannot update the HTML or CSS files directly.  You must use JavaScript and the DOM only for your tasks today.**

## Instructions

### Task 2a: MVP

#### Create selectors to point your data into elements

#### Update the HTML with the JSON data

#### Add new content

* [ ] Change the color of the navigation text to be green.
* [ ] Utilize `.appendChild()` and `.prepend()` to add two new items to the navigation system. You can call them whatever you want.
* [ ] Check your work by looking at the [original html](original.html) in the browser
